        "Long Description": "The goal with this project is to build a system to centralize and simplify data management for Purdue's 500+ member Outing Club. The new system will include a full-stack website, with server-side code written using Express and NodeJS. The database will use PostgreSQL. The front-end is built with a combination of ReactJS and static HTML/CSS/JS. All of this is deployed using AWS Lightsail. After building a prototype version of the new website, I was elected webmaster for the club and will continue to develop and maintain the site for the next year.",

        "Long Description": "This is the second iteration of my personal website, colinhermack.me. It currently displays my projects, resume, education, and logs of trips that I've been on. Eventually I would like to add a blog as well. The entire site is written in React using JSX, which simplified the development process significantly. It is currently frontend only, however all of the site data is stored in JSON files in order to make it easier for me to update information. Eventually I will probably add a backend component to this site with a database, but right now I am busy with college and other projects and don't have the time. Deployment is done through GitHub pages, using the excellent gh-pages NPM module. This makes it possible to deploy react web applications to GitHub pages, though it did require a bit of trickery with the react-router library to work. This means that the site is still using HashRouter, which is basically ancient technology at this point, but it's all that GitHub pages supports at the moment. But deployment using Github pages make it so much easier and more convenient to update the site that it is worth it in my opinion. Updating the live site is as simple as updating the local site and running 'npm run deploy,' and GitHub handles the rest.",

        "Long Description": "I decided to build this app out of frustration with the fact that every free weather app I could find was either slow, inaccurate, had a terrible UI, or some combination of the three. I liked the user interface of Apple Weather, but it's accuracy has been dubious since Apple switched over to their own forecasting models. The design of this app is obviously heavily influenced by Apple Weather, but it uses the OpenMeteo and National Weather Service APIs for its data, and the OpenMeteo geolocation API for location searching. It also uses the Maptiler JavaScript SDK for map data.",
